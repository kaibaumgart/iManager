# Advantech iManager Linux Driver Set

## Description

This is a set of platform drivers which provides support for multiple embedded
features such as GPIO, I2C/SMBus, Hardware Monitoring, Watchdog, and
Backlight/Brightness control. Those features are available on Advantech
Embedded boards such as SOM, MIO, AIMB, and PCM. Datasheets of each product
line can be downloaded from <http://www.advantech.com>

### iManager (MFD) driver

This is a Multi-Function-Device (MFD) driver which provides a communication
layer to the Advantech iManager Embedded Controller. The type of communication
is message based. The client (sub-driver) requests information from Advantech
iManager and waits for a response (polling). If a response has been received
within an expected time, the data is been extracted from the message and then
hand-off to the caller.

### GPIO driver

This platform driver provides support for 8-bit iManager GPIO
which can be accessed through SYSFS (/sys/class/gpio/). Linux
Kernel config option **CONFIG\_GPIO\_SYSFS** needs to be enabled.

Driver name: ***gpio-imanager***

Depends on:  ***imanager*** (mfd)

This platform driver provides support for iManager I2C/SMBus.

Driver name: ***i2c-imanager***

Depends on:  ***imanager*** (mfd)

#### Module Parameters

**bus_frequency** (unsigned short)

Set desired bus frequency.

	Valid values (kHz) are:
			 50: Slow
			100: Standard (default)
			400: Fast

#### Description

The Advantech iManager provides up to four SMBus controllers.
One of them is configured for I2C compatibility.

	Features:
		Process Call
			Not supported

		I2C Block-Read
			Supported

		SMBus 2.0 Support
			- No PEC
			- No Interrupt


### Hardware monitor driver

This platform driver provides support for iManager hardware
monitoring and FAN control.

Driver name: ***imanager_hwmon***

Depends on:  ***imanager*** (mfd)

#### Description

The Advantech iManager supports up to 3 fan rotation speed
sensors, 3 temperature monitoring sources and up to 5 voltage
sensors, VID, alarms and a automatic fan regulation strategy
(as well as manual fan control mode).

Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius and measurement
resolution is 1 degC. An Alarm is triggered when the
temperature gets higher than the high limit; it stays on until
the temperature falls below the high limit.

Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute).
An alarm is triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a
programmable limit. No fan speed divider support available.

Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values
in millivolts. An alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed
a programmable minimum or maximum limit.

The driver supports automatic fan control mode known as Thermal
Cruise. In this mode, the firmware attempts to keep the
measured temperature in a predefined temperature range. If the
temperature goes out of range, fan is driven slower/faster to
reach the predefined range again.

The mode works for fan1-fan3.

#### sysfs attributes

	pwm[1-3]
		This file stores PWM duty cycle or DC value (fan speed) in
		range:
			0: (stop)
			255: (full)

	pwm[1-3]_enable
		This file controls mode of fan/temperature control:
			0: Fan control disabled (fans set to maximum speed)
			1: Manual mode, write to pwm[1-3] any value 0-255
			2: "Fan Speed Cruise" mode

	pwm[1-3]_mode
		Controls if output is PWM or DC level
			0: DC output
			1: PWM output

	Speed Cruise mode (2)
		This mode tries to keep the fan speed constant.

	fan[1-3]min
		Minimum fan speed

	fan[1-3]max
		Maximum fan speed


### Watchdog driver

This driver provides support for iManager watchdog.

Driver name: ***imanager_wdt***

Depends on:  ***imanager*** (mfd)


### Backlight/Brightness driver

This driver provides support for iManager backlight and
brightness control which can be accessed through SYSFS
(/sys/class/backlight).

Driver name: ***imanager_bl***

Depends on:  ***imanager*** (mfd)


## Build Requirements

Besides the required build tools e.g. gcc, make, and kernel development
packages, the kernel also needs to have sub-drivers enabled depending
on the desired features (MFD, GPIO, SYSFS, HWMON, and I2C).

Off-the-shelf Linux distributions such as Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian etc. usually
provide support for a set of embedded features without having to customize the
kernel.  Support for a certain feature can be verified by checking the kernel
configuration file which is stored under /boot/ directory.

- Multi-Function-Device (MFD) - required for iManager

		$ grep CONFIG_MFD_CORE /boot/config-$(uname -r)

- SYFS for Hardware Monitoring

		$ grep CONFIG_HWMON /boot/config-$(uname -r)

- SYFS for GPIO (GPIOLIB and GPIO_SYSFS)

		$ grep CONFIG_GPIO /boot/config-$(uname -r)

- I2C bus driver support

		$ grep 'CONFIG_I2C=' /boot/config-$(uname -r)


## Build/Install Instructions

Build and install those modules in off-the-shelf Linux distributions:

- Modify Makefile.kbuild according to your requirements.
- Remove 'm' at the end of a CONFIG_ line if the driver *should not* be built.
- Build and install drivers (modules).

		$ make

	Below command will build and install all drivers into the kernel driver
	tree under a single sub-folder named **/extra/imanager/**

		$ sudo make install

	The drivers can be found at

		/lib/modules/current_kernel_release/extra/imanager/

	Use the command ***uname -r*** to get the current kernel release

		/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/imanager/


## Loading and unloading modules

Kernel modules are handled by tools such as *modprobe*, *insmod*, and *rmmod*.
You can use these tools manually.

- Using ***modprobe*** and ***modprobe -r***
- Using ***insmod*** and ***rmmod***

	To load imanager-core module (and its sub-platform drivers):

		$ sudo modprobe imanager-core

	This will load gpio, i2c, hwmon, backlight, and watchdog modules if
	available.

	To load imanager-core module by filename (if it is not already
	installed in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/imanager/):

		$ sudo insmod imanager-core.ko

	To unload a module (gpio, i2c, etc.):

		$ sudo modprobe -r <module name>

	Or, alternatively:

		$ sudo rmmod <module name>


## Using GPIO from user-space

The [Linux GPIO Sysfs Interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/gpio/sysfs.txt)
provides a good source of information regarding GPIO usage through user-space.

Some Linux OSes return a ***Permission denied*** even when using *sudo*
command. In this case you would have to switch temporarily to root user.

- On Debian based systems

		$ sudo su

- Or on Red Hat based systems

		$ su

	Export desired GPIO(s)

		#> echo "248" > /sys/class/gpio/export

	And then switch back to user

		#> exit


### CentOS 6/7 Users Requiring Support for GPIO

Please see [README_CentOS.md](./README_CentOS.md) file for customizing a RHEL
kernel.
